# DebtOps — Interface Inventory and Prototype Specification

**Confirmed scope update — 16 October 2026.** The user's confirmed DebtOps requirements take precedence over the earlier DRMS parity baseline. **C** means confirmed DebtOps capability; **P** denotes an implementation choice within that scope; **O/U** continue to describe only observed/unverified DRMS behaviour. Missing DRMS evidence does not defer Customer Management, automated column mapping, Rider workflows, attendance, Call Centre, email or WhatsApp. Provider selection, template wording and business policy values remain configuration/implementation decisions, not omitted features. See the Feature Coverage Matrix in Plan.md.

Terminology: **Customer** is the UI/business term for the existing party record in **debtors** (Eloquent **Debtor**); **Rider** is collection staff in **staff**, linked one-to-one to **users**. **Client** remains the commissioning company. Retain these existing physical names and models: do not add parallel customers/customer_contacts/customer_addresses/rider_profiles/task_assignments/attachments/task_verifications tables for the same facts.

InteXcode (IXC) · 16 October 2026 · Structural specification, not a visual copy of DRMS.

## Scope and traceability

Read [Plan.md](Plan.md) for evidence E01–E24 and unresolved G01–G08, [Module.md](Module.md) for field dictionaries and business flows, and [Database.md](Database.md) for persistence. O = observed; P = proposed; U = unverified. The inventory includes observed pages, page states and contextual variants, followed by proposed screens needed to implement improvements. Proposed rows must not be counted as discovered DRMS pages. All requested interface attributes are resolved through the common contract below plus the per-screen overrides. A route link alone is not an exercised page; such limits are stated.

## Common interface contract (P unless noted)

| Attribute | Default for every inventory entry unless explicitly overridden |
|---|---|
| Related module / user role / purpose | Supplied by each entry and its M01–M12 module; role grants proposed until role demonstrations. |
| Page layout | Shared shell: fixed header, collapsible sidebar, breadcrumb/title, main responsive content and footer. Standalone access cards and separate settings layout are explicitly identified. |
| Header | DebtOps / InteXcode identity, scoped search, own notifications and account menu. Show environment in nonproduction. |
| Sidebar / navigation | Dashboard; Assignments (batches/import/allocation/tasks/verification); Reports; Staff; Databank; authorized Administration. Permission-aware. The observed menu graph is in Module.md. |
| Breadcrumb | Home → module → list → record/action; access cards have no breadcrumb. List/filter state preserved on Back. |
| Cards | None unless listed; metric/progress/error cards use text labels as well as colour. |
| Tables | None unless listed; all proposed tables use semantic headers, accessible sort, explicit column selection, scoped query and stable ordering. |
| Forms / fields / dropdowns | Entry's Fields are the complete baseline; source field detail is inherited explicitly from M06 for task variants. Required marks, help, labels and field errors; no password autofill into data fields. |
| Buttons / actions | Entry's Controls; distinguish submit/cancel/destructive actions; disable during processing and prevent duplicate submits. |
| Filters / search | None unless listed. List search has debounce, clear/reset and active filter chips. Global search does not replace module search. |
| Modals | None unless listed. P confirmations for sensitive/bulk changes, accessible focus trap and escape/cancel. Never hide mandatory errors behind a dialog. |
| Tabs | None unless listed. Task tabs and reference tabs are proposed; DRMS used collapsible sections in reviewed task page. |
| Status indicators | Text badges for applicable entity state; include submitted/review/payment markers separately. Do not convey state through colour alone. |
| Notifications | P success/error feedback after actions; queued operation shows persisted progress and later own notification. O only where expressly stated. |
| Validation messages | P field-specific, server-backed; summary links to errors. Network/stale session/permission/conflict errors preserve safe input. Existing server validation mostly U. |
| Empty states | P explain no records vs no matches vs no access; offer permitted action/reset. Observed empty states explicitly listed. |
| Pagination | None without table. P server pagination 25/50/100 for regular lists, stable ID tie-break, cursor pagination for large history. O DRMS sampled lists show 10 rows and numbered Previous/Next. |
| Expected interaction / previous-next | Each entry's Navigation. Previous/next task must retain authorized filtered order; first/last controls disabled. |
| Loading / errors / accessibility | P loading skeleton, progress for jobs, actionable retry/correlation ID, keyboard labels, visible focus, 320px mobile usability; no raw exception paths or full financial/identity data in toast. |

Reviewer controls appear only with permission and valid lifecycle state. Domestic and commercial variants use approved versioned field groups; Vacant emphasizes occupancy/classification/meter. Financial values remain source snapshots, not editable cash receipts.

## Interaction and state acceptance

Every proposed screen needs normal, loading, empty, invalid input, denied, stale session, network failure and concurrency-conflict designs where applicable. Preserve values on failed writes; leave financial operations pending until acknowledged. Save and Submit differ: Save retains draft; Submit requests review. An export request creates a job with a stable snapshot, then produces a separately authorized download.

Confirmed DebtOps screens above are implementation scope independently of DRMS. G01–G08 remain reference follow-ups; positive legacy databank, COM DR source detail and source-workbook rules require fixtures, while attendance thresholds, three template contents, domain and provider-qualified calling need activation decisions. A runnable visual prototype is a later implementation artifact; this requested file is the interface inventory and functional prototype specification.

Use at least 44px touch targets, single-column data entry, sticky primary action clear of keyboard/safe area, accessible status text and resumable server drafts. No silent offline completion: show connection state, allow retry and verify server receipt. Admin remains desktop/laptop/tablet optimized with responsive smaller-screen fallback.

### M06 approved initial Rider policy — 17 October 2026 (C)

UI22/UI49/UI50 use the owner-approved [M06 master data and purpose policies](Module.md#m06-approved-policy). Add visit purpose, explicit business applicability, signboard-availability declaration and Backdating Reason. All visits require availability/site status/contact result/outcome; applicable business fields and Other explanation are conditional. Typed remarks and due follow-ups stay separate. Display MYT, server-time default and one previous calendar day limit. Preserve safe form input after validation errors.

Keep mobile forms single column with 44px touch targets, grouped optional business/follow-up sections, current task/schedule/context and clear Start/Save/Proof/Checklist actions. UI23 provides camera or gallery, multiple selections, preview/removal, category/caption, progress, scan status and retry. Show HEIC conversion guidance where unsupported; use JPEG/PNG/WebP here. Every proof belongs to the exact saved visit. New visit versions need their own proof; submitted images remain read-only.

UI51 shows the saved visit, typed remarks/business, exact clean images and conditional purpose checks. Link missing requirements to their editor; keep Submit Completion disabled until valid. Confirm frozen data; UI52 displays Pending Verification and immutable receipt/reference. Returned work shows Admin reason and starts a new draft/version. UI48 preserves filters/search, current assignment access and own redacted receipts after reassignment; no customer/proof disclosure to former assignees.

M14 increment 1 / UI65 (18 October 2026): Communications shows three named owner-approved version 1.0 options and draft/pending working-version links. The editor shows name, subject/body, required-token flags, creator/submission/approval/rejection provenance, history and stale-edit feedback. Save draft, submit exact saved content, approve/reject with a reason, create a replacement draft and archive approved wording are permission-controlled. Approved wording stays active until replacement approval. Sample previews label every value as illustrative; actual-customer previews use current scope and approved source data, with explicit missing financial-data errors. Delivery and private letter artifacts remain unavailable pending their recipient/provider/storage workflows.

M14 owner-approved implementation contract (18 October 2026): initial defaults are Friendly Payment Reminder, Outstanding Balance Follow-Up, and Final Follow-Up Notice, using the exact subjects/bodies supplied by the owner in this session. All five registry placeholders are required in these version 1.0 defaults. Preserve text and names in the initial-default seed; no manual client/payment data is invented. Statuses are Draft, Pending Approval, Approved, Rejected, Archived. Drafts are editable with a lock version; submission freezes content for reserved-permission review. Rejection requires a retained reason/reviewer/time; revision creates a new draft. The existing approved version remains active while a replacement is draft, pending or rejected; replacement approval atomically archives the previous approved version. Published and rejected history cannot be rewritten. Generic template approval follows the separate templates.approve grant; no additional self-approval rule is inferred.

Initial approved defaults record approval_source=owner_default and an approval_reference identifying the 18 October 2026 owner authorization, with no fabricated user FK; approved_at records application of this authorized default. Subsequent approvals record the authorized user's approved_by/time. Add name, submitted_by/at, rejected_by/at, encrypted rejection_reason_ciphertext and retained approval-source/reference metadata on the canonical communication_templates table. Seed only missing initial versions and preserve later business edits. Display the initial integer version as 1.0. Explicit synthetic previews may use labeled illustrative amount/date values; those values never enter actual-customer context or any delivery. Actual-customer previews continue to block required financial amount/payment date without approved provenance. Only Approved versions may enter the later recipient/send workflow; current template preview creates no communication or letter artifact.

### M14 recipient and service-email eligibility increment — owner policy, 18 October 2026

Use canonical communication_preferences (not a duplicate communication_permissions table) for versioned service-collection email authority. Approved basis codes: EXISTING_ACCOUNT_RELATIONSHIP, CLIENT_AUTHORIZED_COLLECTION, CUSTOMER_PROVIDED_CONTACT, EXPLICIT_SERVICE_CONSENT, LEGAL_OR_REGULATORY_BASIS. States: allowed, blocked, unknown, withdrawn, invalid_address, hard_bounced, under_review. No marketing authority or force-send exemption is implied. Unknown/incomplete, any active blocking restriction, pending stop request, withdrawn/invalid/hard-bounced/under-review records are ineligible.

Extend preference records with client/account/optional task scope; encrypted evidence (source/reference, email/email-source, notes, consent notice/method/granted-at where relevant, client-assignment/authority details where relevant); encrypted reason; submitted actor/time, review state/actor/time, superseded record and UUID replay key. An allowed proposal requires a current linked account/contact and a documented basis/source/reference. CLIENT_AUTHORIZED_COLLECTION additionally requires a matching active assignment/task context and authority reference; explicit consent requires notice version, method and nonfuture grant time. Legal basis remains subject to jurisdiction-specific production review. Restriction requests may be customer-wide or contact/account-specific and suppress immediately while pending. Approved changes append a version and retire the previous current record; rejected requests and evidence remain immutable. Block dominates allow, including a matching destination fingerprint across duplicate contacts; account-specific allows cannot erase wider restrictions.

Spatie permissions: communication-permission.create/update/block/approve/override. All are initially reserved, with no automatic grant to existing Admin/Rider accounts. Create/update grants submit proposals; block grant may record immediate restrictive decisions. Approve reviews pending proposals; changing an active restrictive state to allowed or rejecting a pending restrictive request also requires override. No role-name bypass and no inferred legal-notice exception. Audit retains customer reference, previous/new status/basis, actor/time/IP/user-agent and an evidence fingerprint; sensitive reason/source/email remain encrypted in the linked immutable domain record rather than exposed in audit JSON.

UI66 selects explicit scoped contacts within one client, approved template and optional current linked account/task per recipient. Filters narrow the candidate list; they never implicitly select other pages. Selection/preview bounds are configurable (initial maximum 250 rows per preview, independent of the future 1,000/day sending limit). Validate email/context, preferences, required source data, dedupe exact canonical destination/context and exclude every conflicting shared-address group until explicitly corrected and previewed again. Persist all selected rows and safe exclusion codes in canonical communications, under communication_batches, with encrypted recipient/rendering/context and a frozen digest. Counts reconcile exactly; no BCC fan-out. Missing financial provenance is ineligible, never a zero balance or task-derived payment date.

UI67/UI68 provide saved recipient-specific previews, exclusion reasons, history, current-source freshness checks and creator-only cancellation of unsent previews. Source/template/permission/preference changes make a saved preview stale; rebuilding creates a separate immutable preview. Saving a preview is not confirmation of sending: no queued/sent/delivered claims, provider reservation or outbox send occurs in this increment. Actual send confirmation remains unavailable until provider capability, recipient eligibility, quotas/attempts/receipts and authorization rechecks exist. Existing provider/financial/storage integration gates remain.

### M14 queue/quota implementation increment — 18 October 2026

Continue UI67/UI68 with exact-digest confirmation, durable email outbox/Redis jobs, canonical attempts/events/quota reservations and scoped delivery history. No vendor is selected or activated by this increment. The default transport supports no account and performs no network operation; production confirmation requires a selected enabled capability-verified account and an explicitly installed supporting transport. Nonproduction additionally requires an explicit recipient allowlist; no sandbox bypass. Provider configuration/credentials, signed receipt ingestion/reconciliation and production legal approval remain activation dependencies.

Keep frozen preview counters/context immutable and derive live delivery counters from canonical envelopes. Confirm only currently eligible rows after fresh digest/permissions/client-scope checks, with replay-safe confirmation and audited actor/time. Dispatch rechecks actor permissions, client scope, contact/account authority, current recipient/template/context and sandbox eligibility. Application cap defaults to 1000/Kuala Lumpur calendar day via centralized environment-backed configuration (system_settings administration remains future); verified provider rolling quota and per-second admission may lower it. PostgreSQL advisory locks serialize global/provider reservations, Redis middleware also limits queue calls, and quota shortages persist next-attempt time instead of discarding recipients. A 5000 cap is configuration plus verified provider entitlement, not a schema change.

Persist attempts/reservations before external transport without holding a database transaction across the network. Accepted is not delivered. Only an explicit definitive pre-acceptance transient result releases capacity and retries, with configurable capped backoff. Generic exceptions, worker interruption or ambiguous timeouts become unknown, retain reservations and never automatically resend or fail over. Overdue pending attempts are reconciled to unknown by the dispatcher; provider receipts are a later authenticated integration, never fabricated. Batch completed means processing finished, not delivery confirmation. Authorized owner cancellation cancels only unattempted queued work, retaining accepted/unknown/in-flight history. Resume is for paused pending work under current authority and audited permissions; exhausted definitive failures require a new reviewed preview in this increment. Existing default financial placeholders remain unavailable without approved M08 sources.

#### Owner-approved SES configuration update — 18 October 2026 (supersedes earlier quota/provider assumptions)

Amazon SES is selected as the primary email provider; preferred configurable region ap-southeast-1. The actual production domain, dedicated sending subdomain, role-based sender, reply-to, DNS ownership/SES verification and SES account quotas are NOT supplied or verified. Examples such as mail.debtops.intexcode.com are not configured as real verified senders. Credentials remain in environment/AWS secret management and never in source, documentation or communication history.

The owner replaces the earlier KL-calendar-day application allowance with **1000 recipient deliveries per rolling 24 hours**, configurable via MAIL_DAILY_LIMIT; initial application rate is **2/second**, configurable via MAIL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND. Effective daily capacity and rate are the lower of business configuration and verified SES account entitlement. Shared global admission must cover all DebtOps email workers/accounts; provider account rolling usage/rate is separate. Unknown/reserved attempts remain held until reconciliation. Increasing to 5000 requires business approval and verified SES quota/rate/reputation; no schema redesign.

Local/DEV/UAT always enforce exact approved test-recipient allowlists, regardless of a UI or sandbox-flag toggle. MAIL_SANDBOX_ENABLED defaults true. MAIL_LIVE_SENDING_ENABLED defaults false; no verified account/domain/quota/test addresses are provisioned. Production activation additionally requires SES production access, verified domain/DKIM/SPF/DMARC/MAIL FROM and sender, approved wording and evidence, tested queue/throttling, bounce/complaint/suppression handling and explicit approval. This increment must not enable production or live confirmation against an unverified account. Signed bounce/complaint receipt integration remains required before production activation; hard bounce suppresses and complaint blocks pending review, while soft bounce is distinct and does not prove delivery. No SMTP credential, AWS key or secret is requested.

Recipient history retains batch/customer/account/recipient/template version/subject, queue and acceptance timestamps, provider/message ID, attempts/retry count and sanitized failures. Acceptance/sent is not delivery. Receipt/bounce/complaint states must derive from authenticated provider evidence, never local inference. Queue/quota/sandbox/history development proceeds with fake transport tests and the SES adapter behind the verification/activation gates.

### M14 authenticated SES receipts and suppression increment — 18 October 2026

Implement a disabled-by-default Amazon SNS endpoint for SES event notifications, with strict registered account/topic/region checks, bounded request/certificate sizes, trusted regional HTTPS SNS certificate URLs only, no redirects and native OpenSSL validation of SNS SignatureVersion 1/2 canonical bytes (prefer topic version 2). Verify before durable processing. Do not follow subscription confirmation URLs, provision SNS topics or activate accounts. No actual topic ARN, AWS account ID, domain or public callback has been verified. Old signed retries are accepted through durable inbox deduplication; future/skewed or mismatched source/context events require review, not guessed assignment.

Use canonical integration_events for encrypted minimal verified payloads, content digests and pending/processed/needs_resolution state, with durable outbox/Redis receipt workers. Correlate by the exact SES message ID and/or this application's durable attempt tag, always checking account, approved sender and the single frozen recipient. Unmatched early receipts remain retryable for resolution; conflicting IDs/tags, mismatched destinations and unsupported events never attach to a guessed customer. Preserve normalized communication_events with authenticated source IDs. Send acceptance is not delivery. Out-of-order acceptance cannot regress delivery; complaint/hard bounce retain stronger suppression evidence, and soft bounce/delay does not imply delivery or authorize resend.

For Permanent bounce record hard_bounced; complaint and undetermined bounce record under_review restrictions. Provider evidence creates a pending restrictive canonical communication_preferences observation with nullable human recorder and an explicit source integration event; pending restrictions suppress immediately, across canonical duplicate email destinations. No human approval or consent is fabricated. Existing reviewer/override controls govern later review; preferences/history are retained. Email address correction does not silently erase the original address suppression.

Authenticated provider evidence may resolve an unknown envelope to accepted/delivered/bounced/complained/failed and convert held unknown quota to consumed, never release it for resend. Original terminal attempt ambiguity stays immutable; the new receipt event records reconciliation provenance. Receipts are safe before/after the sending worker returns; worker completion must not overwrite already reconciled outcomes. No manual force-delivered or blind resend control exists. Display derived delivery/bounce/complaint timestamps and paginated receipt provenance. Keep production sending hard-gated until real SES/SNS/DNS/queue/suppression acceptance and explicit approval; local tests use synthetic signatures and fake HTTP/transport, never customer email.

SES receipt activation additionally requires a verified SNS topic resource policy restricting publishing to the approved SES source/account/configuration set. Signature verification proves SNS delivery, not independently which AWS principal published the content. Record sns_policy_verified only after this resource-policy check; no such verification is seeded. Sending may select a verified nonsecret configuration_set / MAIL_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET to publish attempt tags and events through that registered SNS destination. No topic, configuration set, subscription, AWS account or public HTTPS endpoint is provisioned by development. Production receipt requests require HTTPS. The existing Sentry policy excludes request bodies; do not log SNS/SES payloads, recipient addresses or raw headers.

M14 private letters increment (18 October 2026): UI65/UI67 uses a currently approved email-slot version with an actual scoped customer/account/task context. Freeze escaped literal subject/body, placeholder provenance, requester and a confirmation digest in the canonical encrypted communication envelope (channel=letter). Sample previews cannot generate customer artifacts; missing approved financial source data blocks generation. Require the separate reserved communications.generate_letter permission plus communications.compose/view and customer/task scope; no existing grants are broadened. Confirm exact saved content; changed sources invalidate preview. Durable outbox and Redis exports work generate one private, encrypted S3 PDF via the approved Dompdf renderer, with external resources, PHP and JavaScript disabled. Recheck requester authority and template approval at execution. Failed work retains a safe error and supports explicit authorized retry; duplicate jobs cannot replace a generated artifact. Generated means a file exists, not email delivery or postal dispatch. Reauthorize task/customer access at signed, user-bound, short-lived application downloads and verify content digest. Audit preview/confirmation/generation/retry/download without storing message text in logs. Reuse communications, communication_events, documents and outbox_events; no letter_templates or parallel delivery table. Existing email-only preferences do not authorize or record postal dispatch. Real S3/Redis and deployment integration remain acceptance gates.

Private-letter implementation note: communications.requested_by is a nullable FK to users, mandatory and immutable for letter envelopes and null for other implemented channels. Letter states are draft → queued → generated/failed/cancelled, with explicit failed → queued retry. Current template approval, source revisions and permissions are rechecked at execution. Clean letter PDF means trusted server-generated escaped content, not an uploaded-file scanner attestation. Provider send fields remain null. See README.md private-letter validation and operational notes.
